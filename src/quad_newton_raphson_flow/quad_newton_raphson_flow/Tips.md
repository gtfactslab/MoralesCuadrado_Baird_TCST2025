## Using Ctypes for Nonlinear Predictor
1. run the following in order to compile the code and generate the shared library:
    1a. "gcc -shared -o nonlin_0order.so -fPIC nonlinear_predictor_0order.c" 
    1b. "gcc -shared -o nonlin_1storder.so -fPIC nonlinear_predictor_1order.c" 
2. make sure you have the right address of the shared library in the code in line 58: 
    self.my_library = ctypes.CDLL('/home/username//ros2_ws/src/package_name/package_name/nonlin_0order.so')  # Update the library filename
    2a.  Just go on VSCode and right-click on the libwork.so file and click on copy path (NOT relative path)
    2b. ORRR: go to the directory where libwork.so is in your bash shell and enter "pwd" and copy the results
